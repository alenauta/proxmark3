The iceman fork
===============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iceman1001/proxmark3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iceman1001/proxmark3)  [![Coverity Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/5117/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/proxmark3_iceman_fork)  [![Latest release] (https://img.shields.io/github/release/iceman1001/proxmark3.svg)] (https://github.com/iceman1001/proxmark3/releases/latest)

##This fork is HIGHLY experimental

##Notice      
There is so much in this fork,  with all fixes and additions its basically the most enhanced fork to this day for the Proxmark3 device. Which makes it so awesum to play with. Witt all coverity scan fixes this client is much more stable than PM3 Master.

##Offical
The official Proxmark repository is found here: https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3

##Coverity Scan Config & Run
Download the Coverity Scan Self-buld and install it.
You will need to configure  ARM-NON-EABI- Compiler for it to use:

- Configure
`cov-configure --comptype gcc --compiler  /opt/devkitpro/devkitARM/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc`

- run it (I'm running on Ubuntu)
`cov-build --dir cov-int make all`

- make a tarball
`tar czvf proxmark3.tgz cov-int`

- upload it to coverity.com

##Whats changed?
Whats so special with this fork?  I have scraped the web for different enhancements to the PM3 source code and not all of them ever found their way to the master branch. 
Among the stuff is

	* Jonor's hf 14a raw timing patch
	* Piwi's updates. (usually gets into the master)
	* Piwi's "topaz" branch
	* Piwi's "hardnested" branch 
	* Holiman's iclass, (usually gets into the master)
	* Marshmellow's fixes (usually gets into the master)
	* Midnitesnake's Ultralight,  Ultralight-c enhancements
	* Izsh's lf peak modification / iir-filtering
	* Aspers's tips and tricks from inside the PM3-gui-tool, settings.xml and other stuff.
	* My own desfire, Ultralight extras, LF T55xx enhancements, bugs fixes (filelength, hf mf commands ), TNP3xxx lua scripts,  Awid26,  skidata scripts (will come)
	* other obscure patches like for the sammy-mode,  (offline you know), tagidentifications, defaultkeys. 
	* Minor textual changes here and there.
	* Simulation of Ultralight/Ntag.
	* Marshmellow's and my "RevEng" addon for the client.  Ref: http://reveng.sourceforge.net/    Now using reveng1.31
	* J-Run alternative bruteforce Mifare nested auths.. (you need one other exe to make it work)
	* A Bruteforce for T55XX passwords against tag.
	* A Bruteforce for AWID 26, starting w a facilitycode then trying all 0xFFFF cardnumbers via simulation. To be used against a AWID Reader.
	* A Bruteforce for HID,  starting w a facilitycode then trying all 0xFFFF cardnumbers via simulation. To be used against a HID Reader.
	* Blaposts Crapto1 v3.3
    * Icsom's  legic script and legic enhancements
    * Aczid's bitsliced bruteforce solver in 'hf mf hardnested'

---	
Give me a hint, and I'll see if I can't merge in the stuff you have. 

I don't actually know how to make small pull-request to github :( and that is the number one reason for me not pushing a lot of things back to the PM3 master.
	
##PM3 GUI
I do tend to rename and move stuff around, the official PM3-GUI from Gaucho will not work so well. *sorry*	

##Development
This fork now compiles just fine on 
   - Windows/mingw environment with Qt5.3.1 & GCC 4.8
   - Ubuntuu 1404, 1510
   - Mac OS X  (or before the hardnested BF solver at least)

##Homebrew (Mac OS X)
These instructions comes from @Chrisfu, where I got the proxmark3.rb scriptfile from.
Further questions about Mac & Homebrew,  contact @Chrisfu  (https://github.com/chrisfu/)

1. Install homebrew if you haven't yet already done so: http://brew.sh/

2. Tap this repo: `brew tap iceman1001/proxmark3`

3. Install Proxmark3: `brew install proxmark3` for stable release or `brew install --HEAD proxmark3` for latest non-stable from GitHub.

##Docker container
I recently added a docker container on Docker HUB.  You find it here: https://hub.docker.com/r/iceman1001/proxmark3/
Follow those instructions to get it up and running.  No need for the old proxspace-environment anymore.

##Note from Jonathan Westhues
Most of the ultra-low-volume contract assemblers could put
something like this together with a reasonable yield. A run of around
a dozen units is probably cost-effective. The BOM includes (possibly-
outdated) component pricing, and everything is available from Digikey
and the usual distributors.

If you've never assembled a modern circuit board by hand, then this is
not a good place to start. Some of the components (e.g. the crystals)
must not be assembled with a soldering iron, and require hot air.

The schematics are included; the component values given are not
necessarily correct for all situations, but it should be possible to do
nearly anything you would want with appropriate population options.

The printed circuit board artwork is also available, as Gerbers and an
Excellon drill file.
